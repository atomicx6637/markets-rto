# Directory Overview

This directory contains research and planning documents for a project evaluating an electric utility's entry into a new energy market, specifically a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or the SPP Markets+.

The documents cover the initial research into what these markets are, the business, functional, and technical requirements for participation, and a list of questions to guide discussions with key internal stakeholders. This is a non-code, documentation-based project aimed at strategic planning and requirements gathering.

# Key Files

*   `markets-research.md`: Provides a foundational understanding of RTOs and Markets+. It explains what they are, how they function, and the high-level pros, cons, and technology considerations for a utility.
*   `market-entry-requirements.md`: A detailed breakdown of the specific business, functional, and technical requirements needed to select, implement, and integrate the systems for market participation.
*   `markets-questions.md`: A comprehensive list of questions for various internal stakeholders (Executive, Trading, Operations, IT, and Legal) to help define the scope, goals, and risks of the project.

# Usage
